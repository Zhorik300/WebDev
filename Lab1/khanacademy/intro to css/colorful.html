        <p> <em>Butterflies</em> are some of the most <strong>frequent</strong> insects on the Earth. They are found in nearly every habitat though in others they are solely active for a <strong>short period</strong>. The bugs are known for their distinctive wing patterns and their affiliation with flowers. Almost all species subsist on nectar and so the insects have come to be associated with summer season and the blooming season. Some might eat tree sap, pollen or decaying flesh. Scientists have proven that the butterflies date back to the Paleocene period; approximately fifty six million years ago. The paper focuses on the butterflyâ€™s biology. It discusses its classification, appearance, stages and biological behavior. </p>
